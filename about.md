title: About me
---


I am currently a Research Scientist and Climate Lead at **[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/){:target="_blank"}**, a Board Member of **[Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](wimlworkshop.org/){:target="_blank"}**, and a founding member of **[Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai/){:target="_blank"}**, a global initiative that aims to catalyze impactful work and build a community at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

My work aims to pave the way towards a better understanding of the societal and environmental impacts of AI models, datasets and systems.

I have been called upon by organizations such as the OECD, the United Nations and the NeurIPS conference as an expert in developing norms and best practices for a more sustainable and ethical practice of AI. My academic research has been published in conferences and journals  such as the IEEE, AAAI, the ACM, and the Journal of Machine Learning Research. My work has also been extensively covered in the media by outlets such as the MIT Technology Review, WIRED, the Washington Post, Bloomberg and Business Insider.
