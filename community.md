*I'm a big fan of giving back to my community, and there are several organizations that I'm involved with as a volunteer*:

## Climate Change AI

I am a founding member of [**Climate Change AI**](https://www.climatechange.ai/), a group of volunteers catalyzing impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

## Women in Machine Learning

I am on the board of directions of [Women in Machine Learning (WiML)](wimlworkshop.org/), where I contribute towards the media and diversity/inclusion initiatives.
