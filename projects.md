*My work aims to pave the way towards a better understanding of the societal and environmental impacts of AI models, datasets and systems.*

Some of my current projects are:

* [**Evaluating the carbon emissions of AI models**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/Carbon-Compare) -- my longstanding project is getting a better idea of how much carbon is emitted by AI models and what are the factors that influence it - see my ["BLOOM"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02001) and ["Counting Carbon"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08476) articles.
* [**Stable Diffusion Bias Explorer**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sasha/StableDiffusionBiasExplorer) -- a demo for exploring the biases in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and Dall-E 2.
* [**The Data Measurements Tool**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/data-measurements-tool) -- a tool for exploring and analyzing common datasets used for training and evaluating Machine Learning models.
* [**This Climate Does Not Exist**](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/visualizing-climate-change/) -- in which we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to visualize the potential future impacts of climate change.
* [**CodeCarbon**](https://codecarbon.io/) -- I am contributing to creating a calculator to quantify the CO2 emissions produced during the training of AI algorithms.
* [**Big Science**](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) -- BigScience is a one-year long research workshop on very large language models as used and studied in the field of Natural Language Processing and more generally Artifical Intelligence research. I am co-chairing the carbon footprint working group within the project.
